/**
 * Keeps one-off VOD playback payloads out of Navigation route strings.
 *
 * Native providers can resolve very long signed URLs and DiziPal can return a complete HLS playlist
 * as a data: URI. Putting those values into a Compose Navigation route can exceed route matching
 * limits and crash before the player opens. Only a short token travels through Navigation; the
 * payload stays in-process until the destination consumes it.
